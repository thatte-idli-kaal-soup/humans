## Checklist for video recording

-   Use your own phone to record your video. Zoom recording to the computer may
    work fine. Zoom recording to the cloud seems to be too low-res? Also, using
    your own phone means less editing for removing other people, etc.
-   Record the video in portrait mode.
-   Make sure you are sitting so that you appear in roughly the same portion of
    the screen , for most part of the video. This would make it easier to
    crop/edit for Instagram.
-   Avoid using swear words, if possible. We'd like to be able to post the video
    for Ultimate players in all age groups.
-   Use headphones for talking over video chat. Hearing sounds of pings on your
    computer, or other people typing, makes the audio quality poort.
