# Humans of TIKS

Repository with tools for creating the Humans of TIKS videos.

The videos can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLo98-81j1ocKx7DsxOYNavJx9vmcL0oWx).

## Checklist for video recording

-   Use your phone to record your video.
-   Put your phone in airplane more or in DND mode for the next hour or so.
-   Record the video in portrait mode.
-   Make sure there is adequate lighting where you are sitting.
-   Make sure you are sitting so that you appear in roughly the same portion of
    the screen , for most part of the video. This would make it easier to
    crop/edit for Instagram.
-   Try doing a sample recording of the video. (Use the template question for
    this)
-   Avoid using swear words, if possible. We'd like to be able to post the video
    for Ultimate players in all age groups.
-   Use headphones for talking over video chat. Hearing sounds of pings on your
    computer, or other people typing, makes the audio quality poor.
-   Ensure that your headphones are charged, if they are bluetooth headphones.
-   Have a bottle of water next to you.

## Checklist for posting video

-   [ ] Get pictures from interviewee to make poster. Work on the poster.
-   [ ] Write post description
-   [ ] Figure out hashtags (if any changes are required from the last post)

## Ideas/Suggestions

Some ideas and suggestions provided by various people, that we could try to
incorporate in future videos. Ideally, our tool should incorporate these
features, rather than us adding anything manually.

-   ~~Ask for one question from each team mate. Ask for questions from Instagram
    followers.~~
-   Play some background music. Finding out one music track they listen to, to
    get inspired, and run in the background. This may not work well, but even
    playing some instrumental soft music for all videos may be nice.
-   ~~Make a web-page with all the videos?~~ We already have a YouTube playlist
-   Add an ~~intro and~~ outtro slide.
-   See if we can embed video of people playing/practicing, while they speak
-   Put videos on TikTok? ðŸ˜‚
