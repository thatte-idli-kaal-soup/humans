# Checklists

## Interview Preparation

-   Shortlist next people to interview
-   Contact them and fix a time for the interview
-   Share Video Recording checklist with them
-   Prepare questions, ask team mates/instagram for questions
-   Do the interview and collect the video for editing

## Video Recording

-   Use your phone to record your video.
-   Put your phone in airplane more or in DND mode for the next hour or so.
-   Record the video in portrait mode.
-   Make sure there is adequate lighting where you are sitting.
-   Make sure you are sitting so that you appear in roughly the same portion of
    the screen , for most part of the video. This would make it easier to
    crop/edit for Instagram.
-   Try doing a sample recording of the video. (Use the template question for
    this)
-   Avoid using swear words, if possible. We'd like to be able to post the video
    for Ultimate players in all age groups.
-   Use headphones for talking over video chat. Hearing sounds of pings on your
    computer, or other people typing, makes the audio quality poor.
-   Ensure that your headphones are charged, if they are bluetooth headphones.
-   Have a bottle of water next to you.

## Video Publishing

-   [ ] Get pictures from interviewee to make poster. Work on the poster.
-   [ ] Get a go ahead from the interviewee if the content and poster are okay!
-   [ ] Decide on whether to make a trailer, and post it.
-   [ ] Write post description
-   [ ] Figure out hashtags (if any changes are required from the last post)
-   [ ] If there are "code" changes that potentially change how audio/video
        streams are made, try posting from a trial account to verify Instagram
        doesn't mess up anything.
-   [ ] Make the actual post!
-   [ ] Upload on YouTube and share on the group.

# Ideas/Suggestions for improvement

Some ideas and suggestions provided by various people, that we could try to
incorporate in future videos. Ideally, our tool should incorporate these
features, rather than us adding anything manually.

-   ~~Show longer questions for longer duration of time~~
-   Add an ~~intro and~~ outtro slide.
-   See if we can embed video of people playing/practicing, while they speak
-   Play some background music. Finding out one music track they listen to, to
    get inspired, and run in the background. This may not work well, but even
    playing some instrumental soft music for all videos may be nice.
-   ~~Make a web-page with all the videos?~~ We already have a YouTube playlist
-   Figure out best time to post based on when our audience is online.
-   Captions on videos may be nice, especially when the audio is noisy.
-   Put videos on TikTok? ðŸ˜‚
