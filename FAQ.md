# What is "Humans of TIKS"?

Humans of TIKS is a series of videos of people in the TIKS Ultimate Club

light them up!  You can find the first season of videos
[here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLo98-81j1ocKx7DsxOYNavJx9vmcL0oWx)

# Why are you doing this?

“After nourishment, shelter and companionship, stories are the thing we need
most in the world.”  ― Philip Pullman

Humans of TIKS is a way for us to capture and share stories of the humans of
TIKS with the world, including the past and future players of the team!

It is a hope to capture the culture of the team, an attempt to leave a trail of
legacy for the team...

It could also be seen as plain social media marketing content, if you like.

# How do you go about it?

- A couple of us would have a free-wheeling free-wheeling conversation with
  you, where you share everything that matters to you! Don't feel obliged to
  stay on topic or answer questions succintly.

- The idea is to know you as a person, and to get to know your journey with
  Ultimate, Sports and Fitness.

- We can either have the conversation remotely, or in person.

    For remote conversations:

    - Use your phone to record your video, and join the video call on a different
      device.

    - Make sure you have enough space on your phone to be able to record for half
      an hour to an hour. You'll need about 3-4GB of space if you are recording at
      1920x1080. We can also record via Zoom, if that is not possible for you.

    - Record the video in landscape mode.

    - Put your phone in airplane more or in DND mode for the next hour or so.

    - Make sure there is adequate lighting where you are sitting.

    - Make sure you are sitting so that you appear in roughly the same portion of
      the screen , for most part of the video. This would make it easier to
      crop/edit for Instagram.

    - Try doing a sample recording of the video. (Use the template question for
      this)

    - Use headphones for talking over video chat. Hearing sounds of pings on your
      computer, or other people typing, makes the audio quality poor.

    - Ensure that your headphones are charged if they are bluetooth headphones.

- We'll share an edited version of the conversation with you for your approval
  before publishing it. Only things you are comfortable sharing with the
  "world" will be included.

- Avoid using swear words. We'd like to be able to post the video for Ultimate
  players in all age groups.

- Use gender-neutral language/pronouns wherever you can. Use they/them or
  she/her instead of saying he/him/his. Person-D not Man-D. etc.

- It would help to have a bottle of water handy. :)

- Please share with us about 10 photos of you that you really like. Ultimate
  related or any pictures related to the topics you talked about. We'll include
  them in the final video as overlays.
